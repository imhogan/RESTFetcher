# Qrvey Sample 2
This sample demonstrates the use of RESTFetcher to choreograph a collection of microservices to deliver an application for self-sign-up for email subscription to scheduled and ad-hoc surveys.
This sample uses the free tier of the qrvey.com API. To use this you will need to get an API Key - see http://www.qrvey.com/ for details on how to do this. You will also need an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account - see https://aws.amazon.com/ - and 
you will need to verify one of your email addresses with AWS SES (Simple Email Service) - see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-email-addresses.html 
for details on this. Note, to send to non-verified email addresses - eg to send out Qrvey invitations - you will need to move your account out of sandbox mode. See http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/request-production-access.html for details on doing that.
